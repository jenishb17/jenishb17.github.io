                    <p>I developed an AI-powered stock prediction tool that analyzes historical data and macroeconomic indicators, 
                    a predictive accuracy of 85%. This project integrated machine learning models with a data pipeline that incorporates 
                    Python libraries for data fetching, preprocessing, and model training. Leveraging tools like Yahoo Finance API 
                    for stock data, APScheduler for automated retraining, and Matplotlib for data visualization, 
                    the system enhances overall robustness and accuracy. The tool includes a Flask web interface for user interaction, 
                    automated model retraining, and comprehensive data visualization.

                    <p>
                        I created an XML-based database integration using VBA and SQL to connect Microsoft Access with Excel, 
                        significantly transforming data handling processes. 
                        This project involved designing and implementing a seamless data transfer mechanism between Access and Excel, 
                        ensuring data integrity and efficiency. By utilizing VBA, 
                        I automated complex data tasks and streamlined workflows, 
                        reducing manual input and error rates. 
                        Additionally, I employed SQL for advanced data queries and manipulations, 
                        enabling robust data analysis and reporting capabilities. 
                        This integration demonstrated my advanced database management skills, 
                        as I developed a system that optimized data processing, improved accuracy, 
                        and enhanced overall operational efficiency, 
                        showcasing the full potential of Microsoft Office tools in a professional setting.</p>

                    <p>Engineered a sophisticated PDF scanning system utilizing Python and VBA to automate 
                        the management of private client files. 
                        This system expertly extracts data from PDF documents and integrates it directly into Excel spreadsheets, 
                        thereby eliminating the need for manual data entry. 
                        The innovation significantly increased workforce productivity by optimizing data processing workflows, 
                        improved data accuracy through automated checks, and streamlined overall data management operations,
