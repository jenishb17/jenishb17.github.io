                <h1>Hello, I am Jenish Bharucha</h1>
                <p>I am 20 years old, and a dedicated student pursing a Computer Science and Business Administration double major 
                    degree at Wilfrid Laurier University, where I expertly combine technical skills with business insights. 
                    Currently as a data analyst, I utilise my extensive skills in Excel and VBA to decode complex data sets 
                    and drive impactful decisions. My deep-seated passion for addressing global challenges propels me to innovate, 
                    particularly in the fields of technology and space exploration. 
                    One of my notable projects is an AI/machine learning stock predictor application, 
                    which leverages APIs and Python libraries to achieve an impressive 85% accuracy in market predictions. 
                    Additionally, I developed a PDF document scanner for my workplace, 
                    a tool that has greatly enhanced operational efficiency by streamlining document management processes. 
                    My ambition is to continue applying innovative solutions to real-world problems,
                    making a tangible difference in the world.
