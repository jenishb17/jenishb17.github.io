                <h3>BDO Mind Munchies</h3>
                <p> Mind Munchies is a concept created for the BDO New Venture case competition, 
                    proposing natural cookies aimed at enhancing concentration and focus for university students. 
                    The idea included snacks that would contain brain-boosting ingredients like Theobromine, Creatine, and Omega-3,
                    providing a healthier alternative to caffeinated beverages and sugary snacks. 
                    Through this project, I showcased my finance, marketing, and leadership skills by actively guiding 
                    and contributing to the development of this innovative solution.</p>

                <h3>Wealthsimple Learn</h3>
                <p> I proposed the WealthSimple Learn app concept during the WealthSimple Case Competition, 
                    blending financial insight with marketing strategy. 
                    Leading a diverse team, I demonstrated leadership and analytical skills, 
                    designing a customer-focused app to enhance financial literacy among students. 
                    This project highlighted my ability to integrate educational content with practical tools, 
                    effectively engaging a younger audience and positioning WealthSimple for expanded user engagement.</p>

                <h3>Rize Sport Event Management Company</h>
                <p>At RIZE, a sports event management company, 
                    I was deeply involved in both outreach and financial operations. 
                    My responsibilities included financing and securing venues for events and finding and engaging sponsors, 
                    which required strong negotiation and communication skills. 
                    Additionally, I managed financial tasks such as preparing and maintaining balance sheets, 
                    providing a solid foundation for the company's financial health and enabling precise budget tracking 
                    and event cost analysis. This role allowed me to develop a comprehensive skill set in financial management 
                    within the dynamic context of sports event organization.</p>
